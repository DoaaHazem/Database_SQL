# SQL Data Analysis Workshop  

This project contains solutions and practice tasks from the **SQL Data Analysis Workshop**.  
It demonstrates skills in writing SQL queries to perform data exploration, filtering, aggregation, and reporting.  

## 🚀 Project Overview
- Hands-on SQL exercises for data analysis.  
- Focus on real-world scenarios such as filtering, grouping, and joining tables.  
- Structured queries to answer business-related questions.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **SQL**  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for organizing queries and results)  

## 📂 Files
- `SQL Data Analysis Workshop.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing all SQL tasks and solutions.  

## 📖 How to Use
1. Open the notebook in **Jupyter Notebook** or **JupyterLab**.  
2. Run the cells to view the SQL queries and their corresponding outputs.  
3. Use the queries as a reference for learning or applying SQL in data analysis.  

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Writing SQL queries with `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`.  
- Performing **aggregations** (SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc.).  
- Using **JOINs** to combine multiple tables.  
- Applying conditions and subqueries for deeper insights.
