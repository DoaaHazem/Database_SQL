# 🗄️ SQL Data Analysis Workshop
This project was developed as part of a task assigned by the **Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI)**,  
under the **Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT), Egypt**.  

It contains SQL queries and solutions for analyzing datasets, focusing on **filtering, aggregation, joins, and reporting**.  
The tasks were implemented and documented in a **Jupyter Notebook**.  

---

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **SQL for data analysis**.  
It covers:
- 🔍 Filtering data using **`WHERE`**
- 📊 Aggregating results with **`GROUP BY`**
- 📑 Sorting query results using **`ORDER BY`**
- 🔗 Combining multiple tables using **`JOIN`**
- ➕ Applying aggregate functions such as **`AVG`**, **`COUNT`**, **`SUM`**, **`MAX`**

The goal is to strengthen SQL query-writing skills through practical exercises.  

---

## 🛠️ Features
- Hands-on SQL practice queries  
- Queries designed to answer **real-world business questions**  
- Usage of key SQL clauses and functions:
  - **`WHERE`** → filter data  
  - **`GROUP BY`** → aggregate records  
  - **`ORDER BY`** → sort results  
  - **`JOIN`** → merge data across tables  
  - **`AVG`**, **`COUNT`**, **`SUM`**, **`MAX`** → aggregate functions  
- Implemented in a **Jupyter Notebook** for better documentation

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
By completing this workshop, you will learn how to:
- Write efficient SQL queries  
- Perform data analysis using **aggregations, joins, and filtering**  
- Translate business requirements into SQL queries  
- Document SQL work clearly in a notebook
